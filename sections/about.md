# Welcome!

*Dear Dr. *Verbal*,

I have created this online space to share with you (and others who may be interested) the implementations of the computational-level formalisations that we developed together in our dialogues in [this]() paper. Check out the different individual models, explore different parameter settings, run some simulations, and check out the simulation results to better understand differences between the models and how you may be able to test and compare them empirically. 

Sincerely, 
Dr. *Formal*. *
