# Welcome

> Dear Dr. *Verbal*,

>Welcome! I have created this online space to share with you (and others who may be interested) the implementations of the theoretical models that we developed together in our Dialogue 1 and Dialogue 4 in [this paper]().

> You can browse the Table of Contents on the sidebar. Check out the different individual models and explore different parameter settings. You can also run the Scala code and perform some simulations. Have a look at the simulation results to better understand differences between the models and how you may be able to test and compare them empirically.

>Sincerely,
> Dr. *Formal*.
